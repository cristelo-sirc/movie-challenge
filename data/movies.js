The highlights of the show included pyrotechnic effects, several stage illusions and a stuntman. True to his aim of spreading love around the world, Jackson donated the proceeds from the tour (over $100 million) to charity. On October 1, 1992, the image and sound recordings that are hotly sought after by Jackson fans around the world were also made. The concert recording, which was broadcast on the HBO channel, picked up in 60 countries and also transmitted by countless radio stations, still inspires people around the globe.",

He vents his loneliness, frustration and feelings of isolation from family and friends by being a brat to his private Secret Service agent. When the agent snaps from the strain in front of the First Lady, a new agent is assigned to Luke.

At first, Luke tries all his old tricks upon Sam. But instead of getting angry, Sam seems to actually understand.",

Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill… or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables’ most personal battle yet.",
